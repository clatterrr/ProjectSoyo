         The next step is to capture attention, but not just any attention―don’t aim for going viral. Instead, focus on crafting content that resonates with your ideal customer. Begin by sharing helpful insights, whether it’s through tweets, reels, YouTube videos, shorts, or LinkedIn posts. The key is to offer value that's relevant to your audience, as this will help position you as an expert in your field. When people recognize that you genuinely know your stuff, they’ll be more inclined to trust you, which can lead to future sales. You'll need to consistently do this over time.


        We tell stories. Stories that resonate and hold up over time. Stories that are true, because we made them true with our actions and our products and our services.

We make connections. Humans are lonely, and they want to be seen and known. People want to be part of something. It’s safer that way, and often more fun.

We create experiences. Using a product, engaging with a service. Making a donation, going to a rally, calling customer service. Each of these actions is part of the story; each builds a little bit of our connection. As marketers, we can offer these experiences with intent, doing them on purpose.
