         The next step is to capture attention, but not just any attention—don’t aim for going viral. Instead, focus on crafting content that resonates with your ideal customer. Begin by sharing helpful insights, whether it’s through tweets, reels, YouTube videos, shorts, or LinkedIn posts. The key is to offer value that's relevant to your audience, as this will help position you as an expert in your field. When people recognize that you genuinely know your stuff, they’ll be more inclined to trust you, which can lead to future sales. You'll need to consistently do this over time.
