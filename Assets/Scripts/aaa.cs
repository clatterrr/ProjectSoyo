    Generate Scripts



    HowCanWeDoSth           how you can achieve anything to generate the script
    WeUseSth                we use chat GPT so just go ahead and open a new chat
    ICreatePromptForScript  I've created perfect prompts that will give you a script
    Describe                as you can see it's pretty long
    ForYourConvience        so I'll give you a Google doc Link in the description so you can get all the prompts that I've used in this video

    Tips_Summary            in this Niche 3 to 4 minutes of video perform well
    Tips_DontDo             so we will not make 10 to 15 minutes long videos
    Tips_Do                 instead make it short under 5 minutes

    https://youtu.be/DRB8NJLAw6E?t=308
    IUseToolSimple          for script I will use chat GPT
    IUseDetailed            I will simply use a special prompt that I made to get the best possible script
    ForYourConvience        you can access the prompt from the description feel free to use it in the prompt
    MyGoal                  I have asked chat GPT to provide me script for whatever movie
    MyGoalDetailed          for instance we will take the movie named the Meg
    YouUseYouLike           but you can use any movie you like
    DoItYourself            but again I would advise you to read the script for once and do some changes in it if needed and make it more engaging
    MethodYouNoNeed         by getting your script through this method you won't have to waste your time in watching the full movie and writing its explanation
    MethodYouJust           just read the script and boom you got all the idea about what is happening in the movie

    https://youtu.be/pVykPqQDIe8?t=307

    GoChat                  then I would come over to our good friend chat GPT
    AskGPT                  and ask it for the benefits of these ingredients
    AnysisResult            since the first ingredient is ashwagandha we can see that ashwagandha really helps enhance Sleep Quality and treats insomnia

    https://youtu.be/3Vzfoq73iYQ?t=188

    UseChatGPT              to do that we will open chat GPT and use this prompt
    Prompt                  I'm creating a 30second Tik Tok video promoting your product I want you to rewrite the following script using exactly the same structure writing style tone and length and here you need to insert the original script from the competitor's video
    GPTResult               so by using this prompt chat GPT will generate a script similar to the one that went viral
    ForExample              for example the original script starts with ... and the one we generated begins with ...
    ExplainDetail            so it follows the same style but isn't a duplicate

    https://youtu.be/pT3ZUZ2DL3g?t=65

    UseChatGPT              and search for chat GPT
    IUseDetailed3           once it opens you should type reword this and paste the script you copied (use chatgpt level0, use prompt level2, type word level3)
    UsageDetail             this will make the script monetizable
    ItIsImportant           that is why it's very important
    PromptToImage           after chat GPT is done type this create prompts from this to use in Leonardo Ai
    Explain                 and chat GPT will create prompts for you to generate images in Leonardo

    https://youtu.be/pT3ZUZ2DL3g?t=157

    PleaseDoSth             now add this at the beginning of your script
    Prompt                  the last one will surprise you
    ItLooksBad              this might look like nothing
    ButTrustMe              but believe me
    ItGood                  a lot of people will watch your video to the end
    Explained               because they want to know what the last

    https://youtu.be/VOfC13e3oHk?t=404

    LookExample             In just take a look at the video I was able to make with this formula
    Go                      so let's Dive Right In
    Step                    the first step is writing a script for this part
    PleaseDoSth             I'll advise you to write it yourself
    Explained               and this is why chat GPT and other AI tools will generate a script that looks Faker than my sister's Gucci bag
    SoYouNeed               so to avoid this you need to learn how to write an engaging script all by yourself
    IUseToolSimple          but once again for the sake of this tutorial I'll use the greatest AI of all time chat GPT plus
    Compare                 it isn't great but it's actually smarter than the old chat GPT
    ScriptWrite             so to generate your script go to type this
    ItLooksBad              this prompt sounds like it was written by a 3-year-old
    ItGood                  but AI can easily handle any prompt you type

    ====================================== Voice Over ======================================

    IUseToolSimple          for that we will use 11 laabs

    ====================================== Edit =============================================

    https://youtu.be/VOfC13e3oHk?t=762

    IUseToolSimple          we're going to use one of the best beginner-friendly editing software wondershare film

    Explained               it mentioned all of them and explained a few things about their background

    https://youtu.be/VIu2dzOCRrw?t=285

    AIChange                  but since AI created this there's probably going to be some stuff that you might want to change right
    Steps                   so I'm going to show you the three best ways to improve your videos on this site
    Bad                     after watching our first draft I noticed that the hook is pretty boring
    BadIsImportant          if you don't hook the viewer in the first 30 seconds then you're not going to get views
    WeMustChange             so we need to improve this

    ================================= Money =============================================

    https://youtu.be/VIu2dzOCRrw?t=65

    AbleMoney               we can see that they are are indeed approved for monetization
    HowMuch                 but how much are they actually making 
    CPM                     to know this we need to get a sense for their cpms
    CPMDetailed             a CPM is the amount that an Advertiser pays per 1,000 views on that channel
    ExactCPM                luckily for them the Carnes has a CPM of around $4
    Math                    so now we just do some simple math
    MatchDetailed            17 million views divided by 1,000 * 4 as you can see they've likely made more than $65,000 already
    InShortTime             and they started this channel just 9 months ago
    Good                    obiousviously not bad

    ============================== Generate Video  ===========================================

    https://youtu.be/VIu2dzOCRrw?t=160

    Intro                   next we're going to come over to the new AI tool that makes all of this possible
    Called                  it's called invidio Ai
    WantKnow                 and you guys are going to be pretty mind-blown about how automated this process can truly be
    EntryPage               once you're in it's going to take you to this page where you can input a prompt and give a detailed instruction on what we're looking for in our video
    PleaseUsePrompt         and this is the prompt formula that you should use
    ForYourConvenice        I pasted a copy of it below in the description for you so you can basically just plug and play with whatever topic that you personalize
    MyGoal                  with for my video our goal is to make a video as close to the example that got 13 million views as possible
    Prompt                  so I'm going to have it create a 12-minute video
    Explained               and the reason that I want it to be 12 minutes is because once you're monetized you can run midr ads on any video that's longer than 8 minutes
    Explained               meaning you can get double or triple the ad Revenue that a video that's shorter than 8 minutes might get
    TellAI                  next I'm going to tell the AI that this is for YouTube and what we're talking about
    TellAI                  we're going to tell it to use stock footage and this is
    EntryPage               we're just going to click generate video and it's going to bring us to this screen
    ExplainePage            here you can see that they're trying to understand our audience
    WaitAIWorking           then click continue now we're going to let the AI do its thing
    Advantage               no more wasting hours script writing no more looking for stock footage no more hunting down good music in video's AI can do all of this for us

    OpenWebsite             you'll be redirected to this page
    SingIn                  where you can create a free account
    PageEntry               when you enter in video AI the first thing you'll you see is this text box right here
    Explained               and this box is the simplest way to generate videos
    UsePrompt               so I could type for example
    WaitAIWorking           and inv video AI is smart enough to make that happen
    NotBest                 however this is not the best way to generate videos
    MoreAdvancedWay         as this tool offers much better abilities
    FrameWork               so I'm going to share three methods I use myself and the second is actually my favorite

    https://youtu.be/_0nm9_m3yyE?t=424

    ItisGood                so as you saw the video turned out pretty well
    IsGood                  and the fact that we only provided the article link to make this video is actually impressive
    NextStep                but don't forget that this is one out of three methods I'm going to show you
    AIChange                so let's say you don't like something and want to make some changes
    ItisEasy                well that's actually very simple to do
