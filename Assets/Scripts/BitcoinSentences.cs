    Wtf                 most of this year we were seeing lower weekly closes
    Change              now that is starting to change
    Risistence          Bitcoin did meet the descending broadening wedge resistance just today
    Jection             and found a rejection although
    ReQuestion          not every red candle is a bad candle a lot of times you got to ask yourself is this constructive
    YesReQuestion       and as of right now it is constructive
    NewSupport          previous resistance is now the new support
    InMyView             so in my opinion this is constructive
    LooksGood           and it's looking good
    LookBack            now moving back to the weekly chart
    MACD                if you look at the weekly and you pull up your weekly macd
    Cross               the weekly macd has crossed up
    NotSeen             this is something we haven't seen since April of this year
    Continue            I mean that's like six or seven months of negative momentum and then negative momentum waving and then coming back now to positive
    ForSetting          and for the macd on the weekly
    ForSetting          I like to make an adjustment go to the settings
    Strategy            and go to your inputs and use Fibonacci numbers 13 and 34 if you do 13 and 34 
    Explained           it Smooths out the macd a little bit
    Explained           it doesn't give you as many fake outs
    BackToSetting       now going back to default settings
    Notice              you can see there's a lot of little fake outs in here
    ExplainedAgain      but if you use the Fibonacci numbers 13 and 34 gives you a nice smooth macd with less fake outs
    CrossUp              and on these magd settings we're also just now starting to cross up with these settings
    ItIsGood            you don't get that many false signals

    IReveal             in this video you'll learn the simplest day trading strategy for beginners
    ItIsEasy            you literally don't need any experience to be profitable
    TheStrategy         and it's the strategy I wish I would have known when I first started out
    Profitable          because it uses Concepts that professional Traders use
    ItIsEasy             but simplified so much that anyone can do it
    ItIsEasy             and just because the strategy is simple
    Profitable          doesn't mean it's not profitable
    BackTest            as I've also did a back test of it and it came out with a staggering 65% win rate
    ItIsGood            which is pretty good for just a simple strategy
    ItIsEasy            so let's get started the strategy is so simple
    OnlyOneNotice       we only look at one indicator
    NothingElse         and we don't have to think about anything else
    Terms               and that indicator is the 50 EMA
    Explained            the 50 EMA is the 50-day exponential moving average
    Explained2          it is a line on a chart that shows an average price of an asset over the last 50 days
    WithHelp            but with more weight given to recent prices to apply this strategy
    ItisEasy            all we need to have on the screen is just a price chart and the 50 EMA
    PickChart           to do that pick the chart you want to analyze and click indicators here
    ForSetting          we look for EMA we open it and go to settings and set it to 50
    ExplainedDetail     so what we're looking for is a chart where the price is moving below the 50 EMA such as in this chart
